# ML-guides_books
### ISLR Springer_ 7 edition (latest 2021) edition available currently
### All time favourities to start with Machine learning.
### Light on maths but covers a good depth on Statistics, machine learning and clustering methods
### Mathematics for Machine Learning is de facto material for understanding the math behind the ML algos. 
### If in short of time I recommend to go through first 4 chapters
